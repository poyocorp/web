# Website

## Main Page

The Main Page is a photo of Sprout Poyo moving up and down. There's a side bar that brings up the menu with a title saying "Menu" and a [Sprout Pet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73f5cf96-d377-47b0-aebf-63d8d677d920) with multiple options, these being:

* Admin (if an admin cookie is detected)
* Sprout Poyo Unboxing
* Photography
* Cool Stuff
* Credits

You can also see two social buttons, these being:
* Discord
* r/sproutpoyo (Reddit)

These redirect to the Sprout Poyo Fan Servers.
